# Dijkstras-Airport-Algorithm
This application was developed to find the fastest route between two airports! The algorithm uses a weight of time and cost to find the best route. 

## Example:
The airport data is entered via a excel spreadsheet and then converted into a graph, The user then enters their departing and destination airport code.
The algorithm then displays the fastest route and cost (time and price function).
